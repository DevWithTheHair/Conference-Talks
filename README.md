## [iOSDevUK](https://www.iosdevuk.com/): Aberystwyth, UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ - September 2019

### Designers + Developers = Best Friends Forever?

How is the relationship between your design team and your development team? Is it highly functional? Or â€˜just professionalâ€™? Maybe it has seen better days? In this talk, weâ€™ll discuss some tips, based on my experience, for how to achieve that highly-coveted â€˜Best Friends Forever (BFF)â€™ status between the Design and Development teams!

## [CodeMobile](http://www.codemobile.co.uk/): Chester, UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ - April 2019

### Whatâ€™s My Age Again?

Have you ever been at a carnival and had your age guessed in one of those quiz games? The carnival barkers usually struggle to determine my age. Whatâ€™s my age again? In this talk, weâ€™ll build a microservice in Swift that will use IBM Watsonâ€™s Visual Recognition API to figure out my age (and the ages of some celebrities)!

## [DevRelCon Tokyo](https://tokyo-2019.devrel.net/): Tokyo, JP ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ - March 2019

### Helping Developers By Podcasting

Many developers are by nature quiet introverts, but thereâ€™s so much to gain from having more conversations â€” from rubber duck debugging, to arguing about spaces vs tabs, to speaking at conferences, and podcasting to the entire world!

In this session, More Than Just Code host Jaime will talk about his experience with a tech podcast and helping developers in their technical careers. Wherever you are on the scale from hermit to world-class famous person tech blogger, how can talking about development and code make the developer community better?

## [Seattle GNU/Linux Conference](http://seagl.org/): Seattle, WA ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ - November 2018

### Iâ€™m Lazy So I Write Tests

Does your team deal with bugs that could have been caught earlier in the development cycle? Wish you could get the benefits of Test-driven development (TDD) but are worried that your dev team might revolt or that stakeholders will think that you're being unproductive? In this talk, we'll discuss an approach I've taken to balance the concerns of developers and stakeholders while simultaneously increasing developer productivity, increasing knowledge sharing, and reducing software defects. I've named this approach "TBD", or "Test-backed development".
