It's not easy to scale an open banking API to handle hundreds of financial institutions and millions of API connections. Creating a high-quality developer experience requires open developer documentation, open source example code, and self-serve API credentials. We'll talk about the challenges faced when providing an open banking API.

Do you spend a lot of time tracking and explaining KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), OKRs (Objectives and Key Results), and other metrics?

Do you wonder if they’re communicating your team’s value?

Or even worse, do you worry that your team’s contributions are being overlooked?

This session comes from my experience in writing narratives to explain the value of DevRel. This has helped DevRel at my company to grow from a single individual to a team of three. This has also helped avoid workforce reductions due to the economy.

## [Seattle GNU/Linux Conference](http://seagl.org/): Seattle, WA 🇺🇸 - November 2018

### I’m Lazy So I Write Tests

Does your team deal with bugs that could have been caught earlier in the development cycle? Wish you could get the benefits of Test-driven development (TDD) but are worried that your dev team might revolt or that stakeholders will think that you're being unproductive? In this talk, we'll discuss an approach I've taken to balance the concerns of developers and stakeholders while simultaneously increasing developer productivity, increasing knowledge sharing, and reducing software defects. I've named this approach "TBD", or "Test-backed development".
