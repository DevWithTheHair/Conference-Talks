### Helping Developers By Podcasting

Many developers are by nature quiet introverts, but there’s so much to gain from having more conversations — from rubber duck debugging, to arguing about spaces vs tabs, to speaking at conferences, and podcasting to the entire world!

In this session, More Than Just Code host Jaime will talk about his experience with a tech podcast and helping developers in their technical careers. Wherever you are on the scale from hermit to world-class famous person tech blogger, how can talking about development and code make the developer community better?
