### What’s My Age Again?

Have you ever been at a carnival and had your age guessed in one of those quiz games? The carnival barkers usually struggle to determine my age. What’s my age again? In this talk, we’ll build a microservice in Swift that will use IBM Watson’s Visual Recognition API to figure out my age (and the ages of some celebrities)!
