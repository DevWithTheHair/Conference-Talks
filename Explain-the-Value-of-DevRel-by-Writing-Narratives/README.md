### Explain the Value of DevRel by Writing Narratives

Do you spend a lot of time tracking and explaining KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), OKRs (Objectives and Key Results), and other metrics?

Do you wonder if they’re communicating your team’s value?

Or even worse, do you worry that your team’s contributions are being overlooked?

This session comes from my experience in writing narratives to explain the value of DevRel. This has helped DevRel at my company to grow from a single individual to a team of three. This has also helped avoid workforce reductions due to the economy.
