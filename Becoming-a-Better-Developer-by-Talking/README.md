Many developers are by nature quiet introverts, but there's so much to gain from having more conversations — from rubber duck debugging, to arguing about spaces vs tabs, to speaking at conferences, and podcasting to the entire world!

In this session, More Than Just Code hosts Tim and Jaime will talk about how their experience with a tech podcast helps them in their technical careers. Wherever you are on the spectrum from hermit to world-class famous person tech blogger, how can talking about development and code make you a better developer?
