### Elementary (Celebrity Recognition), My Dear Watson

Do you ever have trouble matching a name to a face? Or wondered if someone was considered a bonafide ‘celebrity’? Well, wonder no further! In this talk, we’ll build a microservice in Swift that will use IBM Watson’s Visual Recognition API to figure out *who* is a celebrity!

### Deprecation Note

Sadly, [changes to the Watson API](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/visual-recognition?topic=visual-recognition-release-notes#2april2018) have rendered this example defunct.

> The enhanced model does not include `FaceIdentity` information in the response. The identity information refers to the `name` of the person, `score`, and `type_hierarchy` knowledge graph.

However, its successor lives on in [What’s My Age Again?](https://github.com/DevWithTheHair/Conference-Talks/tree/master/Whats-My-Age-Again)
